## About

We understand the critical role that random numbers play in various domains in business and academia. This includes cryptography, simulations, statistical analysis, and experimental research. We are a team of physicisists and engineers specialized in harnessing genuine physical processes to generate random numbers that exhibit true randomness. Our goal is to ensure the utmost integrity and reliability for scientific applications.

## Features

- True Physical Randomness:  Our random numbers are derived from genuine physical phenomena, ensuring an unbiased and unpredictable nature.
- Diverse Sources: We employ an array of techniques to extract randomness from different natural processes, guaranteeing a broad range of generators and distributions.
- Seamless Integration: Easy-to-use interface and support for various programming languages and platforms, making it effortless to integrate randomness into your projects.
- Statistical Analysis: Access reports to ensure the quality and bias of the random numbers generated to gain deeper insights into their properties to validate their suitability for your specific use cases.
- Biased Random Numbers: Option to generate biased random numbers that align with specific natural biases, eliminating the need for artificial bias implementation in algorithms, improving their efficiency and complexity.

## Applications

- Cybersecurity: Random Numbers generate keys for authentication protocols and cryptography
- Biology & DNA: Simulating genetic variations and evaluate the probability of mutations and rearrangements
- Medicine: Randomness in virtual trials and molecular simulations
- Optimization: Simulating complex systems like markets, traffic flux or resource allocation
- AI & Machine Learning: Generate weights for machine learning algorthims and neural networks
- Games: Virtual environments and simulations that depend on creating random and dynamic responses
- Financial Modeling: Simulation of market fluctuations and risk
- Physics: Generate random fluctuations in initial conditions for physical problems (ex. brownian motion, fluid mechanics...)
